42: January 11
- today: technically JS cert is done but I 'gave up' with writing my own, been in a serious brain fog, im not great at math logic in algos and wanted to push through to get to the next step and add to my 'to learn' later on. i know it's not the best and could deter from getting the "actual cert" (whatever that may entail). in my mind it's done but it's not a 100% win in my book either. read through other's code to see what they had done, gone line by line to understand bits and pieces and it DID help quite a bit but will have to do more algo practice later.
